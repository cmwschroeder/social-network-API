# social-network-API

## Description

This project handles the back end of a social media platform. It uses MongoDB in order to store users and thoughts. Each user can have attributed thoughts as well as a friends list. You can read, create, update, and delete any user or thought from the database. You may also add and remove users from friends lists. Each thought also allows for reaction, where any user can add a reaction to a thought. These will be stored in the thought. There are routes for adding and removing reactions as well. This should handle a lot of basic tasks that a social media platform should have.
